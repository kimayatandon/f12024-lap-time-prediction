🔍 Project Overview
We build a dataset using:
Full FastF1 lap data
Track lengths for all 24 races
Tire compound
Tire age
Circuit type (street vs permanent)
Weather (rainfall)
Lap number
Driver & team identity (one-hot encoded)
The final test set is only the Abu Dhabi Grand Prix, allowing us to evaluate how well the model generalizes to the final race of the season.
