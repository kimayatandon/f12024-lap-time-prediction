# f12024-lap-time-prediction
This repository contains an end-to-end ML project that uses FastF1 race data to train a regression model capable of predicting average lap times for each Formula 1 driver during the 2024 Abu Dhabi GP. The model is trained on all 23 previous races from the 2024 season, using every lap from every driver.
